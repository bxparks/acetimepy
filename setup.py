# This implements most of the recommendations contained in

# The 'pyproject.toml' config file is NOT used, because it seems to interfere
# with the `pip3 install --user -e .` command which installs the package as a
# link into this repository. Using a link makes development easier because we
# don't have to constantly reinstall the package.
